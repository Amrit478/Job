I will create a doucment which is for my react file where I am going to make multiple things as follows for "MANAGING FINACES"

I will make user and password registration here and I need to work on the api and the settings for the react where it will send t0 the my backend

<body>
  <h2> LOGIN FORM </h2> 

  <form>

-- class need to be written so we can do css with it -- 

      <label for="username"> Username </label> <br>
      <input type="text" id="username" name="username"> <br><br>

      <label for="password"> Password </label> <br>
      <input type="password" id="password" name="password"> <br> <br>
      
</form>


I will make an app where user can go and register himself

  -- class need to be written so we can do css with it but we can add id if we want for certain coloumnd=s for it -- 




I will make another button on the login page where the user is able to reset password but the get the username only and not permitting him to change his username





I will also make a front page where user has many classes and components which I will think and make as follows or otherwise I have in my laptop which will work as follows
